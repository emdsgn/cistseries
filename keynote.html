  <p class="body">Aparicio Carranza is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering Technology at The New York City College of Technology (CityTech) of The City University of New York (CUNY), Brooklyn, NY; and was the Department Chair from 2007 to 2013. He is an adjunct faculty in the Engineering Department (CE & EE) at SUNY New Paltz, NY, (Teaching Undergraduate and Graduate courses since Spring 2015). He is also an adjunct faculty in the Department of Mathematics & Computer Science at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, NY, (Teaching Undergraduate and Graduate courses since Fall 2016 – online and onsite). Professor Carranza earned his Doctorate in Electrical Engineering (EE) from The Graduate School and University Center (CUNY); Bachelor of Science in EE (summa cum laude) and Master of Science in EE from The City College of New York (CUNY); and a AAS in Electronics Circuits and Systems (summa cum laude) from Technical Career Institutes of New York. Dr. Carranza worked as an engineer and scientist at the Development Division of IBM Corp. in Poughkeepsie, NY for several years. He was a design engineer team member for the I/O Switches for the IBM RS­6000 Sytems, Logic Verification and Simulation of I/O subsystem for the S/390 mainframe computers, failure analysis of I/O adapter cards, PCB schematics development; and also led the development of the hardware design and simulation process for ISO 9001 Certification by Underwriters Laboratories (UL). Dr. Carranza has served as an advisory council to five colleges (Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology, NY; DeVry University, NY; Bronx Community College (BCC), NY; Technical Career Institute College of Technology (TCI), NY; and SUNY Rockland Community College, NY). Professor Carranza joined CityTech as an adjunct in fall 1996 and as full­time faculty in fall 2000. He has upgraded and taught a wide range of courses at the Associate/Bachelor’s level: analog/digital electronics, programming languages, applied engineering analysis, data communications, Cybersecurity, Linux OS, Applied Digital/Software Technology, engineering design and other related courses. Dr. Carranza’s research interest involves Cybersecurity and Technology Education, Software Defined Networking (SDN), Virtualization and Cloud Computing – During his 19 years+ at CityTech, Dr. Carranza has involved dozens of students to perform undergraduate research. Many students under his supervision have presented/published papers at National and International Conferences (Canada, England, Spain, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica and Peru). In 2016 in Canada, he and his students received the best paper award; and in 2017, in Costa Rica his students were awarded second place award in the best student paper category, from 80+ papers submitted, including PhD students’ work. Dr. Carranza has published a Book Chapter, Several Journal Papers; and numerous papers in conference proceedings. He has served as conference presentation chair, and also has served as Scientific and Technical Committee member to more than 7 International Conference venues (ASEE, CIST, ONDM, CIT, ICA3PP, HPCC, LACCEI), and reviewed submitted technical papers. At CityTech, Dr. Carranza with his students have presented 50+ posters during the Poster session presentations (November 2003 – 2018).</p>

  <p class="body">Dr. Ziad Kobti is a full professor and director of the School of Computer Science at the University of Windsor, Ontario, Canada. He is also the current president of the Canadian Artificial Intelligence Association (CAIAC.ca). Dr. Kobti's research involves modeling all aspects of intelligent agent systems. He worked in the field of virtual archaeology and anthropology using agent based models to simulate social systems of ancient civilizations in collaboration with Washington State University and Crow Canyon Research Center. He has developed several population evolution based models to enable intervention in artificial social networks using Cutural Algorithms. Recent work has been in developing decision support systems in health care using social network models and agent simulations.</p>
