  <p class="bold">Dr. Luigi Benedicenti</p><img src="../img/Benedicenti.jpg" width="170" align="right" class="keynote-img">
  <p class="body">Dr. Luigi Benedicenti received his Laurea in Electrical Engineering and Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Genoa, Italy. A full professor and dean in the Faculty of Computer Science at the University of New Brunswick, Benedicenti previously served as Associate Dean in charge of Special Projects and as Associate Vice-President (Academic) at the University of Regina. He is a Professional Engineer licensed in Saskatchewan and a licensed Italian Engineer. He created the Software Systems Engineering Program at the University of Regina and became its founding Program Chair. He led the accreditation process for the new program and was subsequently entrusted with the supervision of data collection and computation for all Engineering programs.</p>
  <p class="body">Benedicenti has more than 130 international peer-reviewed publications and has supervised more than 50 graduate students. He is familiar with the Tri-council grant system, the European Union system and the United States National Science Foundation system, having participated in the process as an applicant, a mentor and a reviewer. </p>
  <p class="body">Benedicentiâ€™s current research is in three areas: Software Agents, Software Process, and New Media Technology. Research in Software Agents involves the characterization of software agents and the best applications for the agent model. Research in Software Process aims at characterizing the influence of affect in agile development methods. Research in New Media Technology is directed towards enhancing the understanding of digital communications. A supporter of interdisciplinary work, Benedicenti has developed and supported numerous academic partnerships within the University and with international partners. Benedicenti believes in collaborative environments, clear responsibilities and a strong motivation for success.</p>

  <p class="body">Dr. Ziad Kobti is a full professor and director of the School of Computer Science at the University of Windsor, Ontario, Canada. He is also the current president of the Canadian Artificial Intelligence Association (CAIAC.ca). Dr. Kobti's research involves modeling all aspects of intelligent agent systems. He worked in the field of virtual archaeology and anthropology using agent based models to simulate social systems of ancient civilizations in collaboration with Washington State University and Crow Canyon Research Center. He has developed several population evolution based models to enable intervention in artificial social networks using Cutural Algorithms. Recent work has been in developing decision support systems in health care using social network models and agent simulations.</p>
