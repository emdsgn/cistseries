    <ul class="topics">
<li>Intelligent Systems</li>
<li>Pervasive Computing</li>
<li>Big Data</li>
<li>Deep Learning</li>
</ul>

   <p class="body">If you are interested for your article to be part of the above-mentioned symposiums, please inform us when submitting your article. Symposium articles will go through a regular peer-review process. Accepted symposium articles will be published along with the rest of the accepted manuscripts in the main proceedings. A minimum of 7 articles need to be accepted for each Symposium to go ahead as planned. Should this requirement not be reached, accepted papers will be moved to the main track of the conference in related sessions. </p>

   <p class="body">If you would like to propose a symposium other than the ones mentioned above, please submit your proposal to <a href="mailto:info@cistseries.com" class="body-link">info@cistseries.com</a>. The proposal will be evaluated by the Organizing and Scientific Committees. Upon approval, the Organizing Committee will disseminate the news through the conference website and call for papers. To obtain a high attendance, we kindly ask that the prospective chairs also publicize the event and personally contact researchers who they think will be interested to contribute. The minimum number of registered presenters for the event to take place is 7. Should attendance reach this minimum requirement, registration fees for the Chair will be waived. </p>

   <p class="body">If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@cistseries.com" class="body-link">info@cistseries.com</a>.</p>
